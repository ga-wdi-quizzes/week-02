## JavaScript

### Question #1

**What of the following are JavaScript Data Types?**

Select all that apply:
```
[x] String
[x] Boolean
[] Undefined
[x] NaN
[x] Number
[] Array
[x] Null
```

## Question #2

Explain what is a REPL, and why is it important for us as developers and help with debugging?

```A Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) is an interactive interpreter to a programming language. It originated with LISP systems, but many other languages (Python, Ruby, Haskell, Tcl, etc.) use REPL's to manage interactive sessions. They allow for simple experimentation with a language by bypassing the compile stage of the "code -> compile -> execute" cycle.

```
### Question #3

**Given the Following Array**

var foods = [ ["apple","banana","strawberry"], ["pizza","fries","hamburger"] ];

Create a For Loop that outputs the following string for each piece of fruit in the console. "I want to eat a [fruit]"

```js
//
for(var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++){
      console.log("I want to eat "+foods[i]+"")

Try it Yourself Â»

```
### Question #4

**Given the Following Array**

var foods = [ ["apple","banana","strawberry"], ["pizza","fries","hamburger"] ];

How would I go about accessing the string "pizza" in the above array?

```js
for(var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++){
      console.log("I want to eat "foods[0]"")
```

## Scope/Context/Closures

### Question #5

Describe the rules of scope in JavaScript.

Your Answer:
```Scope is the set of variables you have access to.
```

### Question #6

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```
var pizza = {
  temp : "70",
  bake : temp.replace("70","300"),  
}
```

### Question #7

Using a 'for' loop, iterate over an array of numbers in JavaScript, printing each to the console.

Your Answer:
```var num = ["1","2","3","4","5"];
for (var i =0, i < num.length , i++){
  console.log(num[i]);
```

### Question #8

Write the vanilla JS equivalent of the following jQuery code:

```js
$("button").on("click", function(event){
  $(event.target).css('color', 'red')
})
```

Your Answer:
```js
var changeColor = function(){
  document.addEventListener("click", function(){
   document.getElementById("button").css("color", "red");
 });
 }

## Objects and Functions

### Question #9

What are the differences between calling and referencing a function? Please provide examples of each.

```When you call a function it runs that function.  When you reference a function, the function doesn't execute right then.
```
### Question #10

Using the object literal notation, Define an object called student and give it the properties (your attributes) of name, age, and a method sayHello, that outputs "Hi, my name is [your_name]".

Your Answer:
```js
//
var student = {
  Attributes []
}

## Callbacks

### Question #11

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution?**

Select all that apply:
```
[] Synchronous code runs at an even pace, asynchronous code runs with uneven pacing.
[] Synchronous code runs all at the same time, asynchronous code runs completely randomly
[x] Synchronous code runs in order (as appears in the source), asynchronous code may run at a later time.
```
