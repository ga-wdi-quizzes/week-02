## JavaScript

### Question #1

**What of the following are JavaScript Data Types?**

Select all that apply:
```
[x] String
[x] Boolean
[] Undefined
[] NaN
[x] Number
[x] Array
[] Null
```

## Question #2

Explain what is a REPL, and why is it important for us as developers and help with debugging?


A REPL is a **R**ead-**E**val-**P**rint **L**oop. Iy It reads code input to it, evaluates it,
prints the results, and loops back for more. Developers can use it for rapid prototyping, experiments
with various changes. It can be used for debugging to look at various values. 

### Question #3

**Given the Following Array**

var foods = [ ["apple","banana","strawberry"], ["pizza","fries","hamburger"] ];

Create a For Loop that outputs the following string for each piece of fruit in the console. "I want to eat a [fruit]"

```js
// write code here
for (var i = 0; i < foods[0].length; i++) {
  console.log("I want to eat a " + foods[0][i]);
}
```
### Question #4

**Given the Following Array**

var foods = [ ["apple","banana","strawberry"], ["pizza","fries","hamburger"] ];

How would I go about accessing the string "pizza" in the above array?

```js
var notDominos = foods[1][0];
```

## Scope/Context/Closures

### Question #5

Describe the rules of scope in JavaScript.

Your Answer:
```text
The simplest way to look at it is variables are "in scope" within the functions where they are defined. 
For instance,
```
```js
var i0; // global variable, in scope everywhere, except where noted

function foo1() {
  var i1; // in scope for foo1 and bar1 only
  function bar1() {
  }
}
  
function foo2() {
  function bar2() {
      var i2; // in scope for bar2 only
  }
}  

function foo3() {
  var i0; // overrides the "globalness" of i0 within foo3 only
}
```

```text
For variables, placement is important. 
```
```js
function foo4() {
  function bar4() {
  }
  function i4; // only in scope in foo4, after the declaration. not in scope in bar4 
} 
```
```text 
However, if a variable is used without being declared, such as `i5 = 5;` 
without a `var i5;` before, it becomes global. 

Also, a function declared with `function foo5() {}` is immediately "hoisted"
to the top of the file, so that it is visible throughout.

That is not true of functions defined in the form `var foo6 = function(a,b) {}`.
They are not hoisted but "remain where they are". 

I could probably continue with this, but this is already way too long for the 
scope of a quiz.
```
### Question #6

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```js

var pizza = {
  temperature : 70,
  bake : function() {this.temperature = 300;}
}
```

### Question #7

Using a 'for' loop, iterate over an array of numbers in JavaScript, printing each to the console.

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
var arrayOfNums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8.1,7.2,6.3,5.4,4.5,3.6,2.7,1.8,0.9];
for (var i = 0; i < arrayOfNums.length; i++) {
  console.log(arrayOfNums[i].toString());
}
```

### Question #8

Write the vanilla JS equivalent of the following jQuery code:

```js
$("button").on("click", function(event){
  $(event.target).css('color', 'red')
})
```

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
document.getElementsByTagName("button").this.style.color = 'red';
```

## Objects and Functions

### Question #9

What are the differences between calling and referencing a function? Please provide examples of each.

```text
Calling a function is what is probably thought of as the typical use of a function. The code "calls"s function, possibly with some arguments, it does something, and it possibly returns a value.

Calling a function involves using parentheses, containing the arguments passed to the function (if any).

For instance,
```
```js
function advancedMath {
  var sum;
  sum = 1 + 1;
  return sum;
}

var myPhdThesis = advancedMath;
```
```text
Referencing a function, though, creates a pointer to a function, to use old terminology. It involves just the name of the function, no parentheses or arguments. 
```
```js
function hideIt() {
  $(this).hide();
}

$("p").ciick(hideIt);
```

### Question #10

Using the object literal notation, Define an object called student and give it the properties (your attributes) of name, age, and a method sayHello, that outputs "Hi, my name is [your_name]".

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
var student = {
  name : "Arthur Adams",
  age : 0x31,
  sayHello : function() { console.log( "Hi, my name is " + this.name ); }
}
```

## Callbacks

### Question #11

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution?**

Select all that apply:
```
[x] Synchronous code runs at an even pace, asynchronous code runs with uneven pacing.
[] Synchronous code runs all at the same time, asynchronous code runs completely randomly
[x] Synchronous code runs in order (as appears in the source), asynchronous code may run at a later time.
```
